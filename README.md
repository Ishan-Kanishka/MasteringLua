<h1>This is a brief account on what I'm doing folks </h1>

1.I install LOVE which is useful for creating games using Lua. <br>
2.Then I made a file called main.lua inside a folder named xyz.  <br>
3.I drag the folder(xyz) onto love.exe  OR you can use this command "C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "location of the folder(xyz)" <br>
